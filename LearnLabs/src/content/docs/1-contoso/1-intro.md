## Scenario
You just got hired to join the Contoso Organization to work on an exciting new project - _Contoso Real Estate_ - an enterprise-grade multi-scenario application that is running on Azure. The reference architecture and implementation were _designed_ with extensibility and composability in mind.

Your team wants you to get up to speed quickly on the reference sample, so you can start contributing to new feature development, bug fixes, and other enhancements to the repo. You have access to the open-soure repository and want a structured way to _deconstruct_ the codebase to understand it.

    - Cloud Computing and Web Development Concepts
    - Git, GitHub and ecosystem usage
    - Node, npm and ecosystem usage
    - Visual Studio Code, Extensions and usage.
- Accounts with:
    - Azure _👉🏽 Apply for a free one if needed._
    - GitHub  _👉🏽 Apply for a free one if needed._
    - GitHub Codespaces activated. _👉🏽 Free quota should suffice_.
- Optional tools: 
    - GitHub Copilot (optional). _| Requires a paid plan_.
    - Docker Desktop (optional). _| For local dev container usage_

## Learning Objectives
