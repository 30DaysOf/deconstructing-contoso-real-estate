<!-- 1. Introduction -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the end state of the project after this exercise. Ideally, each exercise unit will create a feeling of closure in the learner. That is, they'll have achieved something that demonstrates progress towards the overall goal. For example, if they're building software, maybe the app will run and perform part of the target functionality. This introductory paragraph summarizes what part(s) of the project will be completed in this unit.

    Heading: none

    Example: "The chocolate-manufacturer needs a separate storage account for their private information. Here, you will create an account with settings appropriate to hold this mission-critical business data. You'll validate the account settings against requirements to check your work."

TODO: describe the end-state functionality after the exercise is completed

<!-- 2. Specification-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the requirements for the part of the project they'll do in this unit. Avoid hints and guidance on how they'll achieve the goal.

    Structure: The specification format is at the author's discretion and will vary based on project type. For example, you could provide any or all of the following:
        - Functional specification for what this part of the project should do when complete.
        - Acceptance criteria (functionality, capacity, resilience, performance, etc.).
        - List of the technologies they should use in this part.

<!-- 3. Validation -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Enables the learner to evaluate if they completed the exercise correctly. This feedback is critical for learning.

    Structure:
        1. H2 of "Check your work".
        2. An introductory paragraph describing how they'll validate their work at a high level.
        3. Numbered steps (if the learner needs to perform multiple steps to verify if they were successful).
        4. Video of an expert performing the exact steps of the exercise (optional).

    Example:
         "At this point, the app is scanning Twitter every minute for tweets containing the search text. To verify the app is running and working correctly, we'll look at the Runs history table."
             "1. Select Overview in the navigation menu.
              2. Select Refresh once a minute until you see a row in the Runs history table.
              ...
              6. Examine the data in the OUTPUTS section. For example, locate the text of the matching tweet."
