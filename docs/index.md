# Table Of Contents

Welcome to `Contoso Real Estate: Deconstruct/Ed` - a series of posts (accompanied by a planned 4-part Learn Live series) to help you learn about building enterprise-grade applications by deconstructing an open-source reference sample that showcases a **Composable Enterprise** Architecture.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this series you should know how to:

1. Explore an open-source sample systematically
2. Define & develop a Composable Enterprise app.
3. Fork, build & deploy _this_ Contoso Real Estate sample.
4. Find opportunities to extend or improve the sample.
5. Find resources to help continue your learning journey.

## Content Series

The following series of posts provides a guided roadmap to achieve the learning objectives. Explore these in four stages:
 - üèÅ | **Kickoff** = Set the stage for deconstructing-to-learn
 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Define** = Decompose app. Learn what, where, why
 - 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **Develop** = Unpack codebase a scenario at a time
 - 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **DevOps** = Understand dev tooling & e2e workflow
 - 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Delivery** = Think best practices & design patterns
 - üèÖ | **WrapUp** = Share Learn Collection, Recap key points

_Content will be written up as a series of #30Days posts released daily in September with the intent to reference & use them in the 4-part Learn Live series. With that in mind, content has been defined to resemble a Learn Module (with units and an exercise per unit or at module level)._
