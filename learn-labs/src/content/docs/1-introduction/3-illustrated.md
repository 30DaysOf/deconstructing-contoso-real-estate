title: 3. Illustrated Guide
description: This is unit 3 of module 1 of our Learn Labs series. Before we dive into the details of this Learn Labs series, let's give visual learners a "big picture" view of what we plan to cover over the first two modules of this series.

To give you a sense of what we will cover over the many modules in this learning path, take a look at the illustrated guide shown below. The tiles are broadly grouped into two sections:
 - The first 8 tiles provide an introduction to the Contoso Real Estate reference implemenation, describing the application specification, and providing context for why the reference sample was needed, and how the architecture decisions were made.
 - The next 8 tiles provide a walkthrough of the developer experience in going from design to delivery of that application specification, providing more details of the decisions made at each step of that journey from a developer perspective.
 
We'll dive into more details for each tile in later units and modules. You can download a high-resolution version of this image at any time from [the SketchTheDocs Gallery](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/cloud-skills/blob/main/gallery/MSBuild-2023-ContosoRealEstate.png)
