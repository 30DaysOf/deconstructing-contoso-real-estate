title: 2. Learning Objectives
description: This is unit 2 of module 1 of our Learn Labs series. We outline the learning objectives for the series as a whole with specific focus on teaching learners how to deconstruct an open-source reference implementation - and not on active deployment of this specific solution to Azure.
---

By the end of this entire series, you should be able to

- Understand why a composable enterprise architecture is key to extensible modern apps
- Design, develop, and deliver, a serverless implementation of that architecture on Azure
- Understand concepts like configuration-as-code, infrastructure-as-code and test automation
- Understand how to use development containers for a consistent dev environment across teams
- Understand how to use Playwright & Azure Developer CLI for end-to-end testing & deployment
- Transfer that knowledge to your own application development needs or processes.
 
## Using GitHub 

The main goal of this series is to **teach you how to deconstruct an open-source reference implementation codebase** on your own. This lets you figure out how real-world solutions are designed, architected and implemented - and transfer that knowledge to your own projects. 

_Having a GitHub account is mandatory since we require you to fork the sample repo, and will make active use of features like GitHub Codespaces to support this objective_.

## Using Azure 

Our learning objectives **do not require you to deploy the application to Azure** as part of the learning journey. The repository does provide guidelines for anyone who wants to take the extra step and deploy the solution to Azure - and you are welcome to explore that on your own if you have an active Azure account and subscription. Just remember that **this is an enterprise-grade solution that will incur non-zero costs if deployed on Azure** - so make sure you review the costs involved and track your spending, or delete the deployment in a timely manner, to avoid unexpected charges.


_Having an Azure account and active subscription is optional for this set of labs. We will focus primarily on solution development & preview within a development container_.
