## Learn Live: Video Series 🆕

In Sept 2023, we ran a 4-part [Learn Live: Serverless](https://learn.microsoft.com/shows/learn-live/?terms=contoso%20real%20estate??WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) series for the [#BuildIntelligentApps](https://aka.ms/FallForIA) initiative. The _Learn Live_ approach focuses on instructor-led livestreams that feature hands-on exploration of relevant training resources. In our case, we used the 4 episodes to create nearly 6 hours of video content that walks you through key aspects of the Contoso Real Estate application from definition to development, testing and deployment.
