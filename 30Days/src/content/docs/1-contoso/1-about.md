## Scenario

You just got hired to join the Contoso Organization to work on an exciting new project - _Contoso Real Estate_ - an enterprise-grade multi-scenario application that is running on Azure. The reference architecture and implementation were _designed_ with extensibility and composability in mind.

Your team wants you to get up to speed quickly on the reference sample, so you can start contributing to new feature development, bug fixes, and other enhancements to the repo. You have access to the open-soure repository and want a structured way to _deconstruct_ the codebase to understand it.
