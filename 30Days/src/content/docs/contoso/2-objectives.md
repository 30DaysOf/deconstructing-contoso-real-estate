title: 2. Learning Objectives
description: what can I learn by completing these lab challenges? How can I use that knowledge?
---

This series follows the _guided project_ format, with each lesson providing a brief introduction that covers relevant concepts, tools and workflows before you dive into a hands-on exercise or _challenge_ that helps you put what you learned into practice. 

:::tip[Get Ready For Take Off!]
- ·õò - Fork the reference sample at [Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/github).  
- ‚≠êÔ∏è - Star the repo if you found it helpful, and spread the word.
- üì¨ - Post questions or feedback using the right [Issues Template](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate/issues/new/choose)

## Complete Challenges
Here is a small subset of the _challenges_ you will complete along the way:

 1. **Fork the open-source sample** to your own GitHub profile.
 1. **Setup your development environment** using GitHub Codespaces.
 1. **Build & Preview the application** using GitHub Codespaces with npm.
 1. **Analyze the Architecture diagram** and identify the prioritized scenarios.
 1. **Analyze the OpenAPI specification** and learn to implement a serverless API.
 1. **Analyze the Project Codebase** and map prioritized scenarios to packages.
 1. **Deploy the Solution to Azure** using Azure Developer CLI.
 1. **Build & Run End-to-End Tests** using Playwright.
 1. **Automate the CI/CD Workflows** using GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.
 1. **Optimize for Costs & Performance** using Azure Monitor and Dashboard.

## Explore Iteratively

Some challenges are actually a collection of _mini-challenges_ that iteratively skill you up in achieving the broader objective. For instance, the _Analyze Project Codebase_ is a series of smaller challenges, each focused on a prioritized scenario such as:

 1. **Build a Blog** using Next.js with Strapi, Azure Container Apps & more.
 1. **Add the Portal** using Angular with Azure Static Web Apps & Functions.
 1. **Add Authentication** using Azure Static Web Apps & Azure CosmosDB.
 1. **Integrate Payments** using Azure Container Apps, Stripe API & API Management.
 1. **Integrate Search** using GraphQL API (now) & Azure Open AI (next)

## Transfer Knowledge

Practicing the tasks will help you build your knowledge of enterprise architectures and end-to-end development, and build familiarity with the Contoso Real Estate codebase. It will also help you _transfer that knowledge_ in three actionable ways:

 - **Apply Learnings & Best Practices** to build your own real-world projects.
 - **Make Open-Source Contributions** to this sample, or other like it.
 - **Explain Solution Architectures & Tradeoffs** to your team or other learners.

## Time Commitment
 1. Each challenge should take < 5 mins to complete (unless stated otherwise).
 1. Challenges should build on each other (so complete them in order)
 1. You can pause & resume activities (using Codespaces to save state)
