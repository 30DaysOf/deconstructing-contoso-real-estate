title: 1. Deconstruct To Learn
description: What is Deconstructing Contoso Real Estate About? Waht are the Learning Objectives?
---

Welcome to a _guided exploration_ of the [Contoso Real Estate](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate) reference sample for an enterprise-grade composable architecture, built with JavaScript, on Azure.


## Learner Roles

This is a beginner-friendly series of lessons suitable for learners in the following roles: _Developer_, _Student_, _Solution Architect_, _DevOps Engineer_, _Educator_.

## Learning Objectives

In this series of lessons (modules) you will practice how to:
 - **Fork the open-source sample** to your own GitHub profile.
 - **Analyze the architecture** and map prioritized scenarios to codebase.
 - **Analyze the codebase** and get inline explanations with GitHub Copilot.
 - **Build and preview** the sample with GitHub Codespaces.
 - **Deploy the sample to Azure** with Azure Developer CLI.
 - **Monitor costs & performance** using the Azure Portal.
 - **Run end-to-end tests** on the sample with Playwright.
 - **Automate CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps

By practicing these tasks, you should also get a better understanding of how to **deconstruct open-source projects** in a way that helps you 
 - **Transfer the knowledge** to your own project design or implementation.
 - **Contribute fixes or features** back to the original open-source sample
 - **Document or explain solution architectures** to your team or other learners.

## Pre-Requisites

To get the most out of these labs, you will need the following:

 - A GitHub Account 
 - An Azure Account
 - Familiarity with cloud computing fundamentals
 - Familiarity with web development fundamentals
 - Familiarity with Node.js, npm and related ecosystem
 - Familiarity with Visual Studio Code and extensions

## Training Costs

The training content and sample are free and open-source. 

However, certain tasks may require the use of paid services (e.g., GitHub Copilot) or involve services with a free tier (e.g., GitHub Codespaces) where your cost may vary based on the available quota at the time of training. 

Completing exercises that _deploy_ the solution to Azure may also incur additional costs. While we have optimized the architecture for the use of free-tier resources, there may be costs incurred for resources that do not qualify, or if your free tier quota has already been exceeded for that account.

To minimize unncessary costs we strongly recommend deleting Azure resources provisioned during these exercises, upon completion. We also strongly advised GitHub Codespaces instances launched during this training be stopped (and/or deleted) upon completion - and that automated triggers be setup in GitHub preferences to halt Codespaces that have been idle for a specified time.
