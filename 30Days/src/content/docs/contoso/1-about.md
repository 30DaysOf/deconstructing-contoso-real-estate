## Learner Roles

This series is beginner-friendly and is ideal for learners in the following roles: 
<br/>_Developer_, _Student_, _Solution Architect_, _DevOps Engineer_, _Educator_.

## Pre-Requisites

To get the most out of these labs, you will need the following:

 - A GitHub Account 
 - An Azure Account
 - Familiarity with cloud computing fundamentals
 - Familiarity with web development fundamentals
 - Familiarity with Node.js, npm and related ecosystem
 - Familiarity with Visual Studio Code and extensions

## Training Costs

The training content and sample are free and open-source. 

However, certain tasks may require the use of paid services (e.g., GitHub Copilot) or involve services with a free tier (e.g., GitHub Codespaces) where your cost may vary based on the available quota at the time of training. 

Completing exercises that _deploy_ the solution to Azure may also incur additional costs. While we have optimized the architecture for the use of free-tier resources, there may be costs incurred for resources that do not qualify, or if your free tier quota has already been exceeded for that account.

:::caution[Take Actions To Avoid Accidental Charges]
- [Delete provisioned Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) after completing the exercise.
- [Stop the GitHub Codespaces instances](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace) launched during the exercise.
- Set spending limits for [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#setting-a-spending-limit) and [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit) usage by default.
