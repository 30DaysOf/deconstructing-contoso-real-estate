# Deconstructing Contoso Real Estate

Building enterprise-grade applications is _challenging_.

So how can you learn to build one? Start by tearing one down!! Say hello to [Contoso Real Estate](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/github) - an open-source reference implementation that adopts a _composable architecture_ to support micro-frontends and a cloud-native backend - and provides the perfect sandbox for hands-on exploration and learning.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a reference implementation that is under active development, meant to act as a _living sample_ for core tools and technologies. Things may break or be in a process of active migration - and that's to be expected. 

The main goal for this project is to _learn how to deconstruct and learn from the open-source project_ so you can then **transfer the knowledge to your own projects and implementation later. If you have any questions or concerns, file an issue to start a discussion on the [project repo](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/github)

## Learn Live

This repository serves as a self-guided series of _Learn Labs_ that mirrors our 4-part [Learn Live Series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/learn-live/?terms=Contoso%20Real%20Estate) of 90-minute episodes:
 1. Ep 1: [Building Composable Cloud-Native Solutions on Azure](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live/Ep1?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) 
 1. Ep 2: [Building Micro-frontends with an API-first design](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live/Ep2?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)
 1. Ep 3: [Integrating 3rd Party Payments and Authentication Features](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live/Ep3?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)
 1. Ep 4: [Deploy with Azure Developer CLI - E2E Testing with Playwright](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live/Ep4?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)


> [!NOTE]
> Our philosophy reflects the "reverse-engineering mindset" for active learning - as compared to the "build from scratch mindset" that is typically covered by documentation and quickstart tutorials.


The idea is not new - reverse engineering and pattern-matching can even be the preferred learning style for some developers. **What we want to do differently** is look at this from the _developer experience_ perspective. We want to raise awareness of key tools and technologies that exist today that do two things:
 - they enhance our _productivity_ by reclaiming time or reducing friction in completing key tasks.
 - they enhance our _technology IQ_ by actively informing or educating us on tools and practices in unfamiliar codebases, in way that help us skill up faster.

## Learning Objectives

- 1️⃣ | Design a _multi-scenario solution_ for extensibility.
- 2️⃣ | Develop in _consistent dev environments_ for collaboration.
- 3️⃣ | Deploy with _unified developer tools_ for productivity
- 4️⃣ | Deconstruct with _AI pair programmers_ for active learning.

Along the way, you'll get familiar with core terms and concepts like:
 1. Composable architecture withan API-first design
 1. Configuration-as-code with development containers
 1. Infrastructure-as-code with a unified tool for deployment
 1. Cloud-native technologies for scalability & cost-optimization
 1. Generative AI for efficient code creation & exploration
 1. Test Automation frameworks for reliable end-to-end testing

And, you'll get a better understanding of core tools & technologies including:

1. GitHub Codespaces - your dev container in the cloud
1. GitHub Copilot - your AI pair-programmer for productivity
1. Visual Studio Code - your IDE for personalization
1. NPM Workspaces - your monorepo for multi-team collaboration
1. Azure Developer CLI - your unified tool for Azure deployment
1. Playwright - your framework for reliable end-to-end testing
