# Deconstructing Contoso Real Estate 

This repository contains a series of posts to help beginners explore the [Contoso Real Estate](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/github) reference architecture in a structured way, and **learn to build** a modern enterprise-grade application by **first tearing it down**.

Here is the planned roadmap of posts:
 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ | `Define` : Take a minute to understand what, where, why
 - 2Ô∏è‚É£ | `Develop`: Start unpacking the project, one piece at a time
 - 3Ô∏è‚É£ | `DevOps` : Take it to production, think about testing & CI/CD
 - 4Ô∏è‚É£ | `Delivery` : Understand best practices, design patterns, resources.
